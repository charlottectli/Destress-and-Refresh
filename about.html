    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="about">Hi, my name is Charlotte! Over the years, Iâ€™ve witnessed my friends go through stressful times: constantly worrying about their grades, fretting about what their future will look like, and more. Iâ€™ve experienced periods like these as well, and sometimes itâ€™s hard to talk it out with people because maybe you feel like a burden to them, or donâ€™t have anyone you feel comfortable enough with to talk to. Therefore, I decided to utilize teenagersâ€™ frequent usage of the internet to create a possible solution: a website centered on teenage stress relief to provide support to those who feel like theyâ€™re alone during difficult times. My website is called Destress & Refresh, and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is separated into 5 categories, one for a different kind of stress a teenager might face; within thereâ€™s a unique activity that aims to relieve stress, such as journaling or a word search, along with online resources targeted to the userâ€™s circumstances. Prior to starting this project, I had no knowledge in any of these coding languages but was able to learn along the way, which is one of my biggest accomplishments from this project in addition to the website itself.<br><br> ðŸ’Œ charlotteli646@gmail.com</p>
